## [Enigma](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma/index) (codename: _Fuzzy Couscous_)<br/>
Created by [Kiera Allen](https://github.com/KieraAllen)

#### Week 6 Independent Project (2003 BE)
Use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

#### Learning Goals / Areas of Focus
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Build classes that demonstrate single responsibilities
- Test drive a well-designed Object Oriented solution
- Work with file i/o

#### Self-Assessment
Based on [this rubric](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma/rubric).<br/>
I evaluate this project as Well Below Expectations. I understood the assignment, but conceptualizing the process took me longer than the allotted time. During the intermission, I want to finish this Enigma project, and I hope to repeat Mod 1 so I am able to work on my fundamental practice and speed.

##### Bonus Material
I learned how to make a [jump link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15481911/linking-to-a-specific-part-of-a-web-page/#answer-15481937)!
